</Info>

## Quick Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Join a Pynqo-Enabled Server">
    Find and join a Discord server that has Pynqo installed. You can identify these servers by looking for Pynqo in the member list or server integrations.
    
    <Tip>Ask server admins if Pynqo is available, or look for servers that advertise keyword monitoring features.</Tip>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Authorize Pynqo">
    <Tooltip tip="This allows Pynqo to send you direct messages with keyword notifications">
      [Click here to authorize Pynqo](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1357613138899374231)
    </Tooltip>
    
    This step is crucial - it allows Pynqo to send you personal notifications when your keywords are detected.
    
    <Warning>Make sure you're logged into the correct Discord account before authorizing.</Warning>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set Up Your Keywords">
    Now you can start adding keywords that you want to monitor. Use the `/keywords manage` command to get started.
    
    ```
    /keywords manage
    ```
    
    <Note>You can add multiple keywords at once by separating them with commas.</Note>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Relax and Get Notified">
    That's it! Pynqo will now monitor conversations for your keywords and send you instant notifications. No more watching chats 24/7!

## Troubleshooting

<Accordion title="I don't see Pynqo in any servers">
Pynqo needs to be installed by server administrators. You can:
- Ask server admins to add Pynqo
- Join communities that already have Pynqo installed
- Look for servers advertising keyword monitoring features
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Authorization isn't working">
Make sure you:
- Are logged into Discord in your browser
- Have the correct permissions in your Discord account
- Are clicking the authorization link while logged into the right account
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Not receiving notifications">
Check that:
- You've completed the authorization step
- Your keywords are properly set up using `/keywords manage`
- Your Discord DM settings allow messages from server members
</Accordion>

<Check>
You're all set! Pynqo is now actively monitoring for your keywords across Discord servers.
