## 1. Join a Pynqo-Enabled Server
Find a Discord server with Pynqo installed. Look for Pynqo in the member list or server integrations.
<Tip>Ask server admins if Pynqo is available, or search for servers advertising keyword monitoring.</Tip>

## 2. Authorize Pynqo
[Authorize Pynqo](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1357613138899374231)
<Note>Make sure you're logged into the correct Discord account before authorizing.</Note>

## 3. Add Your Keywords

```bash
/keywords manage  # Opens keyword management UI
```

- Add multiple keywords separated by commas.
