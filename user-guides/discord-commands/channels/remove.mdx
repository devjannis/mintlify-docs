Use the `/channels remove` command to stop monitoring specific Discord channels or entire categories that you previously added.

/channels remove
```

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Send the Command">
    Execute `/channels remove` in any Discord channel where Pynqo is available.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose What to Remove">
    A selection menu will appear showing all your currently monitored channels and categories. Select the ones you want to stop monitoring.
    
    <Tip>You can see your current monitoring setup using `/channels list` before removing items.</Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm Removal">
    Pynqo will confirm the removal and immediately stop monitoring the selected channels or categories for your keywords.
    
    <Check>The removed channels/categories will no longer generate keyword notifications.</Check>

## When to Remove Channels

<Accordion title="Interest Changes">
When your interests shift and you no longer want notifications from certain channels or topics.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Reducing Noise">
If you're getting too many notifications from high-traffic channels that aren't providing valuable alerts.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Server Changes">
When you leave servers or when channels become inactive and no longer relevant to your monitoring needs.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Refining Setup">
As you fine-tune your monitoring setup to focus on the most important channels for your keywords.
</Accordion>

## Important Considerations

<Warning>Removing a category stops monitoring ALL channels within that category, including any new channels that might be added later.</Warning>

<Note>Removing channels doesn't affect your keywords - they remain active for any other channels you're still monitoring.</Note>

<Tip>Consider using `/channels list` first to review what you're currently monitoring before removing anything.</Tip>

## Effects of Removal

After removing channels or categories:

<Check>**Immediate**: Pynqo stops scanning those channels for keywords right away</Check>

<Check>**No More Notifications**: You won't receive alerts from removed channels, even if your keywords appear there</Check>

<Check>**Other Channels Unaffected**: Your remaining monitored channels continue working normally</Check>

<Warning>**Permanent**: You'll need to use `/channels add` again if you want to resume monitoring removed channels</Warning>

  </Card>
