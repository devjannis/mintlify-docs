Use the `/channels list` command to view all the Discord channels and categories that Pynqo is currently monitoring for your keywords.

```
/channels list
```

<Info>This command shows your complete monitoring setup, helping you understand what channels Pynqo is scanning for your keywords.</Info>

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Send the Command">
    Execute `/channels list` in any Discord channel where Pynqo is available.
  </Step>
  <Step title="View Your Monitoring Setup">
    An organized list will appear showing all channels and categories you've added, along with their custom names and monitoring status.
    
    <Tip>The list shows both individual channels and entire categories you're monitoring across different servers.</Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Your Configuration">
    Check which channels are active and verify your monitoring coverage is complete for your needs.
    
    <Note>If you don't see any channels listed, you'll need to add some using `/channels add` for Pynqo to work.</Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What You'll See

The channel list displays:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Channel Names" icon="hashtag">
    Individual channels you're monitoring with their custom names
  </Card>
  <Card title="Categories" icon="folder">
    Entire categories being monitored, including all channels within them
  </Card>
  <Card title="Server Information" icon="server">
    Which Discord server each monitored channel/category belongs to
  </Card>
  <Card title="Custom Labels" icon="tag">
    The custom names you assigned when adding each monitoring group
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Understanding Your List

<Accordion title="Individual Channels">
These show up as specific channel names (like #general, #announcements) and only monitor that particular channel for your keywords.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Category Monitoring">
Categories appear with their category name and automatically include all channels within that category, including new ones added later.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Custom Names">
The names you provided when adding channels (like "MONITORS CUSTOM" or "SNEAKER ALERTS") help you identify different monitoring groups.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Empty List">
If no channels appear, Pynqo isn't monitoring anything. You'll need to use `/channels add` to configure monitoring before receiving keyword notifications.
</Accordion>

## Common Scenarios

<Check>**Active Monitoring**: You see multiple channels/categories listed - Pynqo is actively scanning these for your keywords</Check>

<Warning>**No Channels Listed**: Your monitoring isn't configured yet - use `/channels add` to set up monitoring</Warning>

<Info>**Mixed Setup**: You have both individual channels and categories - this gives you flexible monitoring coverage</Info>
