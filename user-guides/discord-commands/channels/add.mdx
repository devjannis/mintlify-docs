description: "Add Discord channels or categories for Pynqo to monitor"
---

Use the `/channels add` command to add individual channels or entire categories that Pynqo should monitor for your keywords.

```
/channels add
```

<Info>Adding channels is essential - without configured channels, Pynqo won't monitor anything and you won't receive notifications.</Info>

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Send the Command">
    Execute `/channels add` in any Discord channel where Pynqo is available.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Channel or Category">
    A selection menu will appear allowing you to choose between individual channels or entire categories from the current server.
    
    <Tip>We recommend selecting categories rather than individual channels for comprehensive monitoring coverage.</Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm Addition">
    Pynqo will confirm that your channel or category has been added to your monitoring list and is now being scanned for keywords.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Examples

Here are some common monitoring setups:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Category
/channels add >>> select category >>> TEXT CHATS
```

```bash Channel
/channels add >>> select specific channel >>> general-chat
```
</CodeGroup>

## Categories vs Individual Channels

<Accordion title="Why Choose Categories?">
**Comprehensive Coverage**: Categories automatically include all channels within them, including new channels added later.

**Future-Proof**: When new channels are created in a monitored category, they're automatically included in your monitoring.

**Easier Management**: Monitor entire sections of a server without managing individual channels.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="When to Use Individual Channels?">
**Specific Focus**: When you only want to monitor one particular channel in a category.

**High-Traffic Categories**: If a category has many channels but you only care about specific ones.

**Testing**: When setting up monitoring for the first time and want to test with a single channel.
</Accordion>

## Naming Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Be Descriptive" icon="tag">
    Use names that clearly indicate what you're monitoring (e.g., "SNEAKER DROPS", "TECH NEWS")
  </Card>
  <Card title="Stay Organized" icon="folder-open">
    Use consistent naming patterns to keep your monitoring list organized
  </Card>
  <Card title="Include Purpose" icon="target">
    Add the main topic or brand you're tracking (e.g., "MONITORS SUPREME")
  </Card>
  <Card title="Keep It Short" icon="compress">
    Use concise names that are easy to identify in your channel list
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## What Happens Next?

Once you add channels or categories:

<Check>Pynqo immediately starts monitoring those channels for your keywords</Check>

<Check>You'll receive notifications when keywords are detected in monitored channels</Check>

<Check>The channels appear in your monitoring list (viewable with `/channels list`)</Check>

## Important Notes

<Warning>You must have keywords set up for monitoring to work. Use `/keywords manage` to add keywords if you haven't already.</Warning>

<Tip>You can add multiple channels and categories - there's no limit to how many you can monitor simultaneously.</Tip>
