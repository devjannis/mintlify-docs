Use the `/keywords manage` command to add, edit, or remove your existing keywords.

```
/keywords manage
```

<Info>This command opens an interactive interface for managing all your keywords in one place.</Info>

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Send the Command">
    Execute `/keywords manage` in any Discord channel where Pynqo is available to open the keyword management interface.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter Your Keywords">
    A management screen will appear where you can input your keywords. Separate multiple keywords with commas (e.g., `gaming, streaming, tutorials`).
    
    <Tip>You can add multiple keywords at once by separating them with commas - no need to run the command multiple times!</Tip>

    <Frame>
        <img src="/images/KeywordManager.png" alt="Keyword management interface showing input field" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review and Confirm">
    After submitting your keywords, an embed will appear showing:
    - The status of each keyword (added or already exists)
    - Your current keyword list with exclude values
    - Remove buttons to delete keywords you no longer need

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Status Messages

After managing your keywords, you'll see one of these status messages:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Keyword added!` | The keyword was successfully added to your list |
| `Keyword already added!` | The keyword already exists in your list |

<Warning>Keywords are case-insensitive, so "Gaming" and "gaming" will be treated as the same keyword.</Warning>

## Understanding Exclude Values

<Accordion title="What are exclude values?">
Exclude values are words or phrases that, when present with your keyword, will prevent a notification from being sent. This helps reduce false positives and spam notifications.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do exclude values work?">
If your keyword is "python" but you want to exclude mentions of "python snake", you can add "snake" as an exclude value. Messages containing both "python" and "snake" won't trigger notifications.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Managing exclude values">
You can view and manage your exclude values through the keyword management interface. Each keyword can have multiple exclude values to fine-tune your notifications.
</Accordion>
