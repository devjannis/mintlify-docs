## Alternative Options

Before using this command, consider these alternatives:

<Note>
If you only want to remove specific keywords, use `/keywords manage` to selectively delete individual keywords instead of removing everything.
</Note>

<Tip>
You can use `/keywords list` to review your current keywords before deciding whether to remove them all.
</Tip>

## Safety Reminder
